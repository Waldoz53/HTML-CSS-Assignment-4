Feel free to use lorem ipsum for the content. I will be marking this project based on the following things:

- 4 pages: Home, About, Products, Contact.
- Home page should be a summary of the company or product
- About page should be either a description of the company, or employee bio
- Products page should have a list of products.
- Contact page should have an email input and a text area for comments, and a submit button (this does not need to be hooked up to a backend server)
- Nav should include a Logo
- All links should work
- Include Hero section
- Include Footer with social icons
- Site should be responsive
- Site should have a mobile menu
